FifteenSquare-Game
==================

This is a GUI-Based implementation in Java of the classic puzzle known as the “fifteen-square” or the “fifteen puzzle”. 
This is an old sliding-tile game, dating back to the late 1800’s. 
The puzzle consists of a four-by-four grid of tiles held in a frame. 
One of the tiles is missing, leaving fifteen tiles.

This was an asignment for my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming class.
